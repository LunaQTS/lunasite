		<h1>About Luna Silvana!</h1>
		<p>My name is Luna Silvana, but you can call me Lunes! I am a 16 year old trans girl with Asperger's Syndrome. This website is for my personal <a href="blog.html">blog</a> and overall homepage of my internet prescence.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>I believe that people should be as independent as possible. This website is an example of how easy it is to become independent from social media.</p>
		<p>I'd be a hypocrite to say it isn't useful, however. Mainstream social media, though, should be avoided.</p>
