		<h1>On Moving to Windows 11</h1>
		<p>Recently I switched my main laptop's operating system to Windows 11. So far it has been both easy and a nightmare.</p>
		<p>I had decided to switch due to Pop!_OS giving me problems related to my internet. Because my home machine is placed in my room and not in the living room, I am unable to easily access the router for an ethernet connection. This Wi-Fi problem has been an issue for about as long as I've been using Linux, and I didn't want to waste my time installing another distro and reconfiguring everything all over again.</p>
		<p>It was not long after that I came to the conclusion that I should install Windows again. While I hate the lack of customizability and overall (stable) system tweaking (not to mention the insane RAM usage), it "just works".</p>
		<p>So there I was, installing Windows 11 and setting it up. At first, it was a nice change of pace. I was able to go through the installation without any hassle. I was able to set up my desired programs using the <i>winget</i> package manager. (Yes, Windows now has a <i>package manager</i>.)</p>
		<p>It wasn't until a few days in that I began experiencing Wi-Fi connectivity issues. I noticed it when I was unable to load webpages that quickly, and installing programs in my OpenSUSE Tumbleweed WSL terminal was taking longer than usual. My ping requests always went through like it was normal, however. Windows even showed my signal strength as full bars. I'm not sure what the problem is, but hopefully it doesn't persist unless I'll be installing Ubuntu once and for all.</p>
