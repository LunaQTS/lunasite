		<h1>Yet Another Distrohop. Or Multiple.</h1>
		<p>I have finally fell for the meme. I am now using Void Linux on my main laptop/home computer. Or at least I was for about a day and a half before I tried a bunch of ISOs I had saved on my external hard drive until something worked. In fact, I am currently writing this blog post on <a href="https://antixlinux.com/">antiX Linux</a>. Ignoring the "Proudly anti-fascist" part, it is a fairly decent Linux distribution.</p>
		<p>antiX aims to be a Debian-based distro that can "revive" your old laptop or PC. In my opinion, it meets its goal. Though I in no way have "old" hardware (I'm using a Dell Inspiron laptop with 8GB of RAM and a dual-core i3 with a max clock speed of 3.9GHz), I do find that it is a good choice regardless of specs. It comes with minimal window managers such as JWM, IceWM, and FluxBox. It also pleases the systemd haters and uses sysvinit as its init system.</p>
		<p>I'm currently customizing antiX to my liking, and hopefully soon I'll have a system that doesn't give me headaches.</p>
